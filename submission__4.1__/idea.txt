1. only repeat train data, not validation and test data. repeat = [1, 2, 4]
2. reduce layers number
3. use weighted F1 score to replace macro
4. try: not use ReduceLROnPlateau, it let learning rate reduce significantly when metric stopped improving. ?? stop in local maximization? not improve after 5 epochs.
5. try: change activation function--leaky relu
6. set sample weight as confidence level?  !!!
7. for base bert model: @CITATION@ is tokenize as 1030, 11091, 1030
8. cite2sentence_percent as 0.2
9. learning rate
