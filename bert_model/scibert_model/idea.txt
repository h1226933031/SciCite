2. reduce layers number ignore...
3. use weighted F1 score to replace macro ¡Ì

4. try: not use ReduceLROnPlateau, it let learning rate reduce significantly when metric stopped improving. ?? stop in local maximization? not improve after 5 epochs.

5. try: change activation function--leaky relu ¡Ì
6. set sample weight as confidence level?  !!!   ignore
7. for base bert model: @CITATION@ is tokenize as 1030, 11091, 1030
